jQuery LineWrap

jQuery Plugin for wrapping lines into containers to create nice line backgrounds with padding ect.

You can apply it to any container, container shouldn't contain any tags, text only.

Options for the plugin:

```JavaScript

padding: Array(3,10,3,10) //Padding for each line
margin: Array(0,0,0,0) //Margin for each line
background: '#ff0000' //Background for the lines
mode: 'word' //Depending on the width of the container lines get wrapped by word or letter
align: 'left' //Align inside the container
extrapadding: 0 //Magic

```

Each line gets wrapped inside a div with the class "jq-linewrap-line" if you want to apply further styles
